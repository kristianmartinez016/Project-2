      <div class="metroid-text">
        <h2>Metroid Prime</h2>
        <h3>Something sinister is incubating in the depths of Planet Tallon IV. It's up to 
          interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran to destroy this evil... but first it must 
          be found.</h3>
        <p>What begins with Samus's exploration of a derelict Space Pirate vessel quickly becomes a massive 
        adventure spanning the planet Tallon IV. Wielding classic weapons like the Wave Beam and Powerm Bombs 
        and using power-ups like the Morph Ball and Space Jumpt Boots, Samus will fight a host of gruesome 
        creatures as she explores massive environments in a first-person adventure that truly puts you inside
        the Power Suit.</p>
        <p>Watch as steam condenses on your visor and noxious acid drips down your faceplate. Activate your 
        Scan Visor to study the environment for clues, then switch over to the Thermal Visor to search for the 
        heat signatures of hidden enemies. Incredible technology is at your fingertips, but can you survive long 
        enough to use it?</p>

        <h2>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</h2>
        <h3>Once again, the forces of evil are gathering, and only one young hero can rise to meet their challenge!</h3>
        <p>Link's new adventure begins on an island where his sister is kidnapped by a giant bird. Our Hylian hero sails off 
          to rescue her and finds himself in the middle of the greatest adventure of his life. How will he save his sister? 
          What sinister forces conspired to kidnap her? What mysteries will he solve along the way? Who will help him in this 
          massive quest? Playing this highly-anticipated title is the only way to find out.</p>
        <p>From the start of the game, the wondrous revolution of the Legend of Zelda series is apparent with highly artistic 
        and stylized graphics that show reactions and emotion like never before. You'll see expressions change as characters laugh, 
        cry, show anger, frustration, or surprise. Add outstanding play control, ingenious puzzles, crafty enemies, loads of classic 
        items, and a massive world to explore and you've got an adventure worthy of the Zelda name.</p>

    <!-- SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE-->
      <div class="mario-text">
        <h2>Super Mario Sunshine</h2>
        <h3>When Mario arrives on tropical Isle Delfino, the once-pristine island is polluted and plastered with graffiti. Even worse, 
        he's being blamed for the mess!</h3>
        <p>Now Mario has to clean up the place and track down the real culprit. Luckily, his new multipurpose water pack FLUDD lets him 
        spray goop away and hover over danger. This little invention even has Rocket and Turbo nozzles, and mario will have to master each 
        of them if he hopes to best the hosts of humongous enemies overruning the island.</p>
        <p>Come along on Mario's first adventure on the Nintendo GameCube as he scales soaring cliffs, wall-jumps up perilous passageways 
        and even tightropes as he tours the island, Mario-style. He won't have to go it alone, either—his old pal Yoshi will show up to 
        lend a tongue if the going gets rough!</p>
